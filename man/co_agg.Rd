\usage{
co_agg(..., R = NULL)

co_agg.default(imgs, channels, size, npixel, dstep = 1, pwidth, zstep,
  freec = 1, kern.smooth = NULL, layers = NULL, naming = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Arguments for the \code{co_agg.default} function}

\item{R}{Number of times to run the co-aggregation analysis}

\item{imgs}{The paths of array files; i.e. output from \code{loadIMG} or \code{findIMG} functions.}

\item{channels}{Character vector with names of the two channels to calculate co-aggregation for. Should be in the names of the array files}

\item{size}{The maximum distance (microns) to examine. Has to be a multiple of both pwidth and zstep. Beware, increasing size will increase runtime exponetially!}

\item{npixel}{Number of random pixels to examine. Increasing this will increase precision (and runtime in a linear fashion)}

\item{dstep}{The interval between examined distances (microns). Increasing this decreases resolution but speeds up function linearly. Defaults to 1}

\item{pwidth}{Width of pixels in microns}

\item{zstep}{z-step in microns}

\item{freec}{The number of cores NOT to use. Defaults to 1}

\item{kern.smooth}{Optional. Numeric vector indicating range of median smoothing in the x,y,z directions. Has to be odd intergers. c(1,1,1) means no smoothing.}

\item{layers}{Optional. Should the function only look in a subset of layers. A list with lists of layers to use for each image. Can also be the output from \code{extract_layers}}

\item{naming}{Optional. Add metadata to the output dataframe by looking through names of array files. Should be a list of character vectors, each list element will be added as a variable. Example: naming=list(Time=c("T0","T1","T2")). The function inserts a variable called Time, and then looks through the names of the array files and inserts characters mathcing either T0, T1 or T2}
